## Testing Documentation
### Testing for Core Version of the Code
### Criteria
The robot must follow the path (white line) on the map and must not run into any of the obstacles on the map

|Attempt|Outcome|Issue|Solution|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Robot successfully ran and reached the flag while not running into any obstacles. The white line stayed in the cameraâ€™s FOV, but the robot did not stay on top of the white line. It would start to go off the white line in sharp corners. Time taken to complete map: 51.84 secs|||
|2|Robot successfully ran and reached the flag while not running into any obstacles. Same observations as Attempt 1. Time taken to complete map: 56.33 secs|||
|3|Robot successfully ran and reached the flag while not running into any obstacles. Same observations as Attempt 1. Time taken to complete map: 55.33 secs|||
|4|Robot successfully ran and reached the flag while not running into any obstacles. Same observations as Attempt 1. Time taken to complete map: 55.09 secs|||
|5|Robot successfully ran and reached the flag while not running into any obstacles. Same observations as Attempt 1. Time taken to complete map: 54.56 secs|||
|6|Robot successfully ran and reached the flag while not running into any obstacles. Same observations as Attempt 1. Time taken to complete map: 55.31 secs|||
|7|Robot successfully ran and reached the flag while not running into any obstacles. Same observations as Attempt 1. Time taken to complete map: 55.11 secs|||
|8|Robot successfully ran and reached the flag while not running into any obstacles. Same observations as Attempt 1. Time taken to complete map: 54.51 secs|||
|9|Robot successfully ran and reached the flag while not running into any obstacles. Same observations as Attempt 1. Time taken to complete map: 55.17 secs|||
|10|Robot successfully ran and reached the flag while not running into any obstacles. Same observations as Attempt 1. Time taken to complete map: 55.31 secs|||
