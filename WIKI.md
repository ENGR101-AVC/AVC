### Testing for Core Version of the Code
### Criteria
The robot must follow the path (white line) on the map and must not run into any of the obstacles on the map. This must be done in under 5 minutes.

|Attempt|Outcome|Issue|Solution|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Robot successfully ran and reached the flag while not running into any obstacles. The white line stayed in the camera’s FOV, but the robot did not stay on top of the white line. It would start to go off the white line in sharp corners. Time taken to complete map: 51.84 secs|||
|2|Robot successfully ran and reached the flag while not running into any obstacles. Same observations as Attempt 1. Time taken to complete map: 56.33 secs|||
|3|Robot successfully ran and reached the flag while not running into any obstacles. Same observations as Attempt 1. Time taken to complete map: 55.33 secs|||

Average time taken: 54.856 seconds

### Testing for Completion Version of the Code
### Criteria
The robot must follow the white line on the map and reach the flag without it touching any of the obstacles. The robot must make the correct turns to reach the flag regarding the intersections that are on the map. This must be done in under 5 minutes.

|Attempt|Outcome|Issue|Solution|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Robot successfully ran and reached the flag while not running into any obstacles. The robot made the correct turns when at intersections. The white line stayed in the camera’s FOV, but the robot did not stay on top of the white line. It would start to go off the white line in sharp corners and the robot stays completely off of the white line after turning out of the first intersection but goes back onto the line after turning out of the third turning point. Time taken to complete map: 1 min and 17.27 secs|||
|2|Robot successfully ran and reached the flag while not running into any obstacles. Same observations as Attempt 1. Time taken to complete map: 1 min and 16.21 secs|||
